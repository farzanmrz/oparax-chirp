  // lib/sysprompts (the delivery interface, via draft-pipeline.ts -> draft-council-run.ts;
  // the legacy strip-phrases refresh route and the new-desk create action, both via
  // lib/sources/onboard-source.ts / lib/voice/extract-guide.ts; and /agents/[id]/voice's
  // retryExtraction action, which reaches the same lib/voice/extract-guide.ts path via
  // runExtractionSpendPhase on a manual retry). The per-minute cron dispatcher this list once
  // traced (/api/cron/tick) was deleted with the retired scan/draft pipeline (D15), the
  // /api/chat entry it once traced was deleted with the create-desk chat assistant
  // (create-agent v2 continuation, the deleted create-desk assistant), and the inbound-email
  // webhook entry was deleted with the whole dormant email-correction path — do not re-add any
  // without a route to match. See .claude/rules/agent.md's "Bundling the prompts for deploy".
