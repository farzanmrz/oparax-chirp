 *  logged, never thrown — a stuck pending row is a worse UX bug than a swallowed update error,
 *  but not one worth failing the whole onboarding attempt over. Exported: callers must also
 *  invoke this in their OWN catch block around onboardSource — a genuinely unexpected throw
 *  (gateway auth/network/rate-limit, anything that isn't the schema-validation path
 *  onboardSource itself already handles) needs the same cleanup, or the pending row is stuck
 *  forever with no failure ever surfaced.
 *
 *  Keyed by `configId` (the specific row `reservePendingSource` returned), not by
 *  `(agent_id, url)` — a dismiss-then-re-add of the same URL reserves a SECOND row for that
 *  URL, and an `(agent_id, url)` match would let a stale, still-running old attempt's failure
