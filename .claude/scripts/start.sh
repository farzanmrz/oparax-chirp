#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Close the plan gate: put the approved plan on the issue and land on ft/<issue>.
#
# Usage:
#   start.sh [--prefix ft|bf] "<issue title>" [<plan-body-file>]
#   start.sh [--prefix ft|bf] --issue <N> [<plan-body-file>]   # plan an existing issue
#
# --prefix bf lands on bf/<issue> for the bugfix flow (default ft). The bf
# hotfix path (base main) does NOT use this script: it cuts from origin/main
# directly.
#
# With no plan file (or "-"), the approved plan is read from stdin. stdout is one
# machine-readable line: the issue number. All Git/GitHub chatter goes to stderr.
#
# Feature slices always run on ft/<issue#> (app code never lands directly on
# beta — owner instruction-file micro-edits are the one carve-out; see
# ship/SKILL.md) and there is no persisted run state. A slice is
# identified by its branch, which is the only marker QC needs
# (`origin/beta...ft/<N>`). ship.sh always lands on beta; the terminal release
# target (beta or main) lives only in the conversation and is applied by
# ship/SKILL.md's promotion step after ship.sh returns — it is never
# passed into this script or into ship.sh.
#
# ADOPTION-AWARE (2026-08-04): the owner routinely pre-cuts a branch and a stub
# issue before /feature, so create-only behavior sent every session into
# workaround mode. Branch resolution now goes, in order: already on ft/N →
# adopt in place; local or remote ft/N exists → switch to it; current branch is
# ft/N-<anything> (cut for this issue, off-convention) → rename it to ft/N
# local+remote; nothing exists → create from fetched origin/beta. An adopted
# branch with ZERO commits unique against origin/beta is fast-forwarded onto
# it; one with unique commits keeps its base untouched (said on stderr). The
# clean-tree requirement applies ONLY when the resolution must switch or
# create — updating an issue body needs no clean tree.
#
# UNWRAP (2026-08-04): GitHub renders every newline in an issue body as a hard
# break, so hard-wrapped prose reads ragged at half width. Paragraph lines are
# joined before posting; fences, tables, headings, and list structure are kept.
