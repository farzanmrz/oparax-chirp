# User Journey — Session Log

## 2026-02-26 11:55 — Session `95377bae-eb0c-471a-bd46-de02153c8b58`

### What was done

- **Tech stack table** — Fixed versions (were vague like `5.x`, `4.x`, `latest`), added consistent naming (`Brand Name (npm-package)`), added Purpose column, added Vercel as deployment entry
- **vision.md** — Created with two-part structure: Part 1 (Current Scope & MVP) with core loop flowchart, news detection table (X API shelved → Grok 4.1 active), voice model, build status; Part 2 (Bigger Vision) as enterprise brand automation platform with multi-source/multi-platform diagram
- **project-info.md** — Created with all project primitives: GitHub info, Supabase setup, X.com API details, Vercel setup notes, env var tables, dev commands
- **Consolidated 6 reference files into CLAUDE.md** — Deleted `environment.md`, `frontend-nextjs.md`, `project-layout.md`, `supabase-auth.md`, `testing.md`, `vercel-deploy.md`. Moved critical rules to Do's/Don'ts, conventions inline, project layout as nested tree
- **userjourney.md** — Created this session log
- **session-log skill** — Created `.claude/skills/session-log/SKILL.md`: logs session work to `userjourney.md`, tags entries with date/time/session ID, always asks user for what's remaining (never infers), auto git add/commit/push with user confirmation
- **GitHub Issue #3 rewritten** — Replaced outdated description with phased
  plan: Phase 1 ✅ DONE (docs, shadcn init, test migration, README, skills),
  Phase 2 (Vercel + explore templates/shadcn), Phase 3 (build UI),
  Phase 4 (wire up auth + backend); long-term workflow scope preserved
- **Tech stack discussion** — Educational session: React/Next.js/Vercel
  relationship, TypeScript value, Tailwind v4 vs v3, Supabase as PostgreSQL
  wrapper, Vitest vs Vite, React Router irrelevance, shadcn CLI workflow,
  Vercel template mechanics (creates separate repo, not a branch)

### What's remaining

- **Vercel deployment** — Import `farzanmrz/oparax-chirp` (Import flow,
  not Create new), set root dir to `frontend`, add Supabase env vars,
  add Vercel URL to Supabase redirect URLs

## 2026-02-26 16:35 — Session `444581b9-b43c-4dd6-b8c6-30f72f24a1cf`

### What was done

- **Vercel deployment** — Diagnosed why Vercel showed "Other"
  (root `package.json` has no `next` dep; Next.js lives in
  `frontend/`); fixed by setting Root Directory to `frontend`;
  deployed successfully
- **oparax.com domain** — Configured live custom domain on
  Vercel; updated GoDaddy DNS (A `@` → Vercel IP, CNAME
  `www` → `cname.vercel-dns.com`); site live at oparax.com
- **DNS education** — Explained DNS, nameservers, A vs CNAME
  records, Option A vs B, 301 vs 307 redirects
- **shadcn UI rebuild** — Re-initialized shadcn with Nova
  style, gray oklch palette, Hugeicons, small radius; swapped
  font from Geist to Nunito Sans; installed `login-04` and
  `signup-04` blocks; created separate `/login` and `/signup`
  routes (replacing tab-based `(auth)/` single page); wired
  server actions with error display via searchParams; added
  confirm password validation (`validateSignupForm`); replaced
  Meta social icon with X.com/Twitter; deleted old `(auth)/`
  route group and stale root `package.json`; build passes
- **Documentation update** — Updated CLAUDE.md (project layout
  tree, tech stack, known issues, deployment status),
  project-info.md (Vercel now live), vision.md (build status),
  README.md (full rewrite with current structure and versions)
- **Bug fixes** — Fixed Supabase rate-limit error matching
  (regex instead of exact string since countdown varies);
  fixed button hover states (`[a]:hover` Nova bug — buttons
  had no hover; added `hover:bg-primary/90`, `active`,
  `cursor-pointer`); confirmed by reading Supabase auth logs
- **Landing bird image** — Moved `landing_bird.png` to
  `frontend/public/images/`; replaced placeholder.svg on
  both login and signup image panels
- **Supabase redirect URLs** — Configured `oparax.com` in
  Supabase → Authentication → URL Configuration →
  Redirect URLs; also updated Site URL
- **NOTES.md** — User created brain dump file for low-priority
  bugs and feature ideas; added reference to CLAUDE.md

### What's remaining

- **Button feedback** — Buttons still lack sufficient visual
  feedback on click/hover per user notes; revisit styling

## 2026-02-26 23:45 — Session `444581b9-b43c-4dd6-b8c6-30f72f24a1cf`

### What was done

- **Vercel build warnings** — Fixed `"Ignored build scripts"`
  warning by adding `pnpm.onlyBuiltDependencies` for esbuild
  and msw; fixed `"outputFileTracingRoot and turbopack.root"`
  conflict by removing now-unnecessary `turbopack.root` from
  `next.config.ts` (root `package-lock.json` that caused it
  is gone); both warnings resolved on Vercel
- **Button UX** — Added `active:` press states to outline,
  ghost, secondary, and destructive variants; created
  `SubmitButton` client component using `useFormStatus()` to
  show spinner and disable on submit (forms stay as server
  components); wired into login and signup forms — eliminates
  double-click errors and missing loading feedback
- **lib/ file recovery** — Core files (`lib/supabase/`,
  `lib/validation.ts`, `lib/auth-errors.ts`, `lib/utils.ts`,
  `app/auth/confirm/`) were accidentally deleted locally;
  restored with `git restore`; build confirmed passing
- **NOTES.md cleanup** — Removed resolved Frontend UI section
  (button feedback, double-click, loading state all fixed)

### What's remaining

- **Agentic workflow UI** — Build the core product feature:
  agentic workflow interface on the dashboard

## 2026-02-27 03:49 — Session `59a96a69-8bd6-4fc5-971d-611c840e80f1`

### What was done

- **beta.oparax.com** — Set up staging subdomain on Vercel: added CNAME
  record in GoDaddy (`beta` → project-specific Vercel DNS), assigned
  domain to Preview environment / `ft/3-agentic-workflow-ui` branch in
  Vercel; added `https://beta.oparax.com/**` to Supabase redirect URLs
- **Domain redirects** — Pointed `oparax.info`, `oparax.net`, `oparax.org`
  (and `www.*` variants) to `www.oparax.com` via 301 redirects in Vercel;
  added DNS records in GoDaddy for each (Vercel-first workflow: add domain
  in Vercel first to get recommended DNS values, then set in GoDaddy)
- **Duplicate email signup fix** — Detected Supabase anti-enumeration fake
  success (`data.user.identities === []`) in signup action; redirects back
  to `/signup?error=...` with clear message and sign-in link instead of
  silently landing on check-email page
- **Test suite fixes** — Fixed stale `@/app/(auth)/...` import paths in
  `login-actions.test.ts` and `signup-actions.test.ts`; fixed redirect
  path assertions (`/?tab=signup` → `/signup?error=`); added
  `confirm-password` to `createFormData` helper; added new test case for
  empty-identities duplicate detection; removed dead `auth-page.test.tsx`
  (tested a combined auth page component that no longer exists); all
  37 tests passing
- **Session skills restructure** — Renamed `session-log` →
  `update-user-journey`; created `update-notes` skill for NOTES.md
  management; created `wrap-up` orchestrator (manual, 4-phase: git commit,
  userjourney, NOTES.md, conditional CLAUDE.md/README.md); updated
  `update-claude-md` to fix stale reference table and add README.md scope;
  updated CLAUDE.md Session Workflow section; trimmed CLAUDE.md to 150 lines

### What's remaining

- **Agentic workflow UI** — Build the core product feature:
  agentic workflow interface on the dashboard

## 2026-02-27 10:53 — Session `df04d397-bca7-4eeb-96dd-1fb82fea696e`

### What was done

- **UI/UX planning** — Full product architecture session: planned page structure (`/dashboard`, `/dashboard/workflows/new`, `/dashboard/workflows/[id]`, `/dashboard/settings`), sidebar layout (2 nav items, collapsible icon mode), empty state → wizard → detail page flow; scoped current branch to just the post-login landing shell
- **shadcn components installed** — sidebar, breadcrumb, dropdown-menu, avatar, tooltip, badge, skeleton, sonner, sheet; also `@hugeicons/core-free-icons` (required by Nova style components)
- **Dashboard layout** — Created `frontend/app/dashboard/layout.tsx`: sidebar shell with `SidebarProvider`, auth guard moved here (protects all `/dashboard/*` automatically), top header bar with `SidebarTrigger` + breadcrumb
- **Sidebar components** — `app-sidebar.tsx` (Oparax logo, nav, user footer), `nav-main.tsx` (flat nav with `usePathname` active state), `nav-user.tsx` (avatar initials + sign-out dropdown)
- **Dashboard home page** — Rewrote `dashboard/page.tsx`: empty state (icon + "Create Workflow" CTA) or workflow card list with status badge + metadata
- **Workflow card** — `workflow-card.tsx` with frequency labels, handle count, `timeAgo` relative time
- **Settings page** — `dashboard/settings/page.tsx`: sign out + "Coming soon" for X OAuth and Voice Profile
- **Root layout** — Added `TooltipProvider` (sidebar dependency) and `Toaster` (sonner) to `app/layout.tsx`
- **Supabase migration** — `public.workflows` table: user_id FK, frequency, handles array, status, RLS policy
- **Turbopack fix** — Removed root `package.json` / `package-lock.json` (stale npm artifacts causing Turbopack to infer wrong workspace root → `tailwindcss` resolution failure in dev mode)
- **GitHub issues + branches** — Created #10–#14 covering the full product roadmap; local branches `ft/10-*` through `ft/14-*`

### What's remaining

- **Workflow Creation Wizard** — 4-step form at `/dashboard/workflows/new` (issue #10, branch `ft/10-workflow-creation-wizard`)

## 2026-02-27 15:16 — Session `0492338f-b53e-4e93-b248-2895467f65d6`

### What was done

- **Branch sync** — Merged `main` into `ft/10-workflow-creation-wizard` (fast-forward); branch had been created before `ft/3` merged, so was missing the full dashboard shell
- **shadcn components** — Installed `select` and `textarea` via shadcn CLI
- **Workflow creation form** — Built `/dashboard/workflows/new` as a single-page progressive form replacing the original 4-step wizard: name (optional, auto-generated from description if blank), description, scan frequency (Select), X handles
- **Comma/space/Enter chip input** — Custom `handle-input.tsx`: typing a comma or space instantly converts the text into a `@handle` chip; Backspace on empty removes last chip; duplicate + validation guards
- **Test run (mocked)** — "Run Test" button inside the form card runs a faked 3-phase scan (scanning → analyzing → generating) and reveals 5 unique mock football headlines
- **Headline selection phase** — Selectable headline cards appear after test; user picks which stories to proceed with; "Continue with N headlines" button advances to drafting rules
- **Drafting rules phase** — Style conventions textarea + example tweet textarea appear after headline selection; saved as `style_rules` / `example_tweet` on the workflow row
- **Supabase migration** — Added `style_rules` (text, nullable) and `example_tweet` (text, nullable) columns to `public.workflows`
- **Visual hierarchy fix** — Rewrote all form labels/hints using a custom `FormField` wrapper: page title `text-2xl font-bold`, section headers `text-base font-semibold`, field labels `text-sm font-semibold`, hints `text-xs text-muted-foreground/70` — eliminates the "everything is the same white" bleed
- **Sidebar active state fix** — `nav-main.tsx` now highlights "Workflows" for all `/dashboard/workflows/*` routes
- **Reusable stepper** — `stepper.tsx` built as a generic horizontal step indicator (not used by this page but available for future flows)
- **Tests** — 11 workflow action tests (48 total passing); covers success, auth redirect, validation, name generation, style_rules/example_tweet null handling
- **NOTES.md** — Added two low-priority items: workflow detail 404 and dashboard table view

### What's remaining

- **Workflow detail page (issue #11)** — `/dashboard/workflows/[id]` currently 404s; needs a detail view showing config, run history, and draft review
- **Merge `ft/10` into `main`** — Branch is committed locally; push blocked by network issue this session (run `git push --set-upstream origin ft/10-workflow-creation-wizard` then merge)
